# Welcome to Fiddler Jam

**Fiddler Jam** is a troubleshooting solution for support and development teams to help them troubleshoot issues quickly, easily, and securely. How does it work? Customers share network logs via a Chrome extension instead of manually attaching them to an email or a support ticket. The support team analyzes the logs for troubleshooting. Developers debug further by inspecting the logs in Fiddler Everywhere.

**HTTP(S) traffic Inspection & Analysis**

Fiddler Jam logs all HTTP(S) traffic between your Chrome browser and the Internet.

## Installation

Install the [Fiddler Jam extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fiddler-jam/fnkjlegmkbicdodlheligomlfbdblpfj) directly from the Chrome Extensions store.

## Documentation

[Official Fiddler Jam documentation](https://docs.telerik.com/fiddler-jam/introduction)

We believe documentation is best when the content is a product of collaboration between the builders and consumers of that product. Everybody can play a role in making our documentation better, and we encourage you to help us with that task in the way that you choose:

- Send Feedback
    Use the __Was this article helpful?__ functionality to give us feedback and ideas on improving the documentation. Alternatively, you could request a feature or report a bug using the [Fiddler Everywhere Feedback Portal](https://feedback.telerik.com/fiddler-everywhere).

- Create an Issue
    If you find an issue with our docs that needs addressing, the best way to let us know is by creating an issue in our [Github repository](https://github.com/telerik/fiddler-jam-docs). When creating an issue, please provide a descriptive title, be as specific as possible, and link it to the documentation article. If you can provide a link to the closest anchor to the issue, that is even better.

- Send a Pull Request
    Creating an issue is excellent, but what we love are pull requests. If you find a problem in the docs or even feel like creating new content, weâ€™d be happy to have your contributions! 

    To do this, you must fork our documentation and submit a pull request. That way, you may contribute an update exactly where you found the error. After that, our technical writing team will need to approve your change request. Please use only standard markdown. For more detailed instructions, please follow the [contribution instructions](https://github.com/telerik/fiddler-jam-docs#contributing) published in GitHub.
