# Welcome to Fiddler Jam

**Fiddler Jam** is a troubleshooting solution for support and development teams designed to help them troubleshoot issues quickly, easily, and securely. How does it work? Customers share network logs via a Chrome extension instead of manually attaching them to an email or a support ticket. The support team analyzes the logs for troubleshooting in a safe cloud space. Developers debug further by inspecting the logs in the [Fiddler Jam portal](https://jam.getfiddler.com) or with the help of the Fiddler Everywhere application.

**HTTP(S) Traffic Inspection & Analysis**

The Fiddler Jam Chrome extension logs all HTTP(S) traffic between your Chrome browser and the Internet.

**Screenshots on User Interactions**

The extended log information includes screenshots for each user interaction with the page (clicks) during the HTTP(S) traffic recording. Empower your recording with visual information related to specific reproduction workflows.

**Record Developer Logs**

Record the developer's console logs for additional debug information and for investigation of complex issues on-the-fly.

**Cloud Space Submissions**

Recorded logs can be easily submitted to the Fiddler Jam portal, where they can be saved, organized, analyzed, and shared with other collaborators. The Fiddler Jam cloud portal provides means to control accessibility by providing access rights.

**Fiddler Everywhere Integration**

Submitted logs are compatible with Fiddler Everywhere for in-depth investigation.
