# Welcome to Fiddler Jam!

Progress® Telerik® Fiddler Jam is a troubleshooting solution for end users and for support and development teams, which is designed to help them easily and securely communicate between each other and quickly resolve issues.

The core components of Fiddler Jam are the Fiddler Jam Chrome Extension, which enables end users to capture HTTP or HTTPS network issues and submit logs in a secure environment, and the Fiddler Jam Portal, which stores these logs in the cloud for support and developer teams to locally replicate and further analyze those issues.

What's more, both Fiddler Jam components are fully integrated with the [Fiddler Everywhere web-debugging tool](https://docs.telerik.com/fiddler-everywhere/introduction), which monitors, inspects, edits, and logs all HTTP and HTTPS traffic and provides a number of additional troubleshooting features.

## Fiddler Jam Chrome Extension

The Chrome Extension is aimed at end users and helps them troubleshoot website issues&mdash;instead of manually attaching network logs to an email or a support ticket, they can directly share these logs through the Chrome extension. The submitted logs are automatically and safely stored in the Fiddler Jam Portal cloud and are available for the Fiddler Jam Portal users to inspect and help resolve those issues.

The Chrome Extension solution can be installed, pinned, and used by everyone.

Fiddler Jam Chrome Extension delivers a range of handy and end-user friendly features whose number and further development are not limited by the list in this section&mdash;the Fiddler team constantly invests efforts to improve the performance and add more value to the existing troubleshooting solution, and build on top of its available features.

### Traffic Inspection and Analysis

The Fiddler Jam Chrome extension logs all HTTP and HTTPS traffic between the Chrome browser and the Internet, and enables users to capture network traffic from any application. [Read more about the capturing options of with Fiddler Jam Chrome Extension...]({% slug  %})

### Video and Screenshot Capturing

The extended log information can include a video recording of the expected browser page and screenshots for each user interaction with the page (clicks) during the HTTP(S) traffic recording. Empower your recording with visual information related to specific reproduction workflows.

### Safe Online Log Submission in the Cloud

Recorded logs can be quickly submitted to the Fiddler Jam portal, where they can be saved, organized, analyzed, and shared with other collaborators. The Fiddler Jam cloud portal provides means to control accessibility by providing access rights.

### Sensitive Data Protection

The Fiddler Jam capturing comes with a powerful, default masking feature for masking of sensitive information.




## Fiddler Jam Portal

The Portal is a cloud space that safely stores the network logs submitted by end users and enables support and developer teams to organize, inspect, and analyze them in a safe space. The further monitoring of the logs is enabled through the additional Fiddler Jam Portal debugging options, and can also be inspected with the Fiddler Everywhere web-debugging HTTP-proxy client due to the seamless integration between the two.

The Fiddler Jam Portal option are available for commercial users only&mdash;for more information, refer to the article on [trial version and commercial license]({% slug   %}).
