# Welcome to Fiddler Jam

**Fiddler Jam** is a troubleshooting solution for support and development teams to help them troubleshoot issues quickly, easily, and securely. How does it work? Customers share network logs via a Chrome extension instead of manually attaching to an email or a support ticket. Support team analyzes the logs for troubleshooting. Developers debug further by inspecting the logs in Fiddler Everywhere.

**HTTP(S) traffic Inspection & Analysis**

Fiddler Jam logs all HTTP(S) traffic between your Chrome browser and the Internet.

## Installation

Install the Fiddler Jam Chrome extension. <!--TODO add more info here -->
