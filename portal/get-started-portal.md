# First Steps with Fiddler Jam Portal

This tutorial describes how to install and start using the Fiddler Jam Portal if you have access rights corresponding to the Portal user role.

- First, you will open the customer-provided generated link with a browser.
- Next, you'll access the protected private workspace with the stored logs.
- Finally, you will prioritize the issue, add context, and share it with the development team.

## Prerequisites

* Install the Chrome browser on your machine.

* Provide an active Internet connection with access to the following URLs. To test whether you access the required Fiddler endpoints, use [the Fiddler connectivity check link](https://fiddler-backend-production.s3.amazonaws.com/connectivity-test/check.html).

    ```curl
      https://*.getfiddler.com/
      https://*.amazonaws.com/
    ```
