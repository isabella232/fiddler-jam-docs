## Contact Support

All Fiddler Jam portal users can submit a support ticket through the **Contact Support** option. The support option uses the default email client of the operating system.

## Report Issue

The **Report Issue** functionality allows you to send a detailed Fiddler Jam log with HTTPS capturing, screenshots of the user interactions and video recording from a selected page within the Fiddler Jam portal. Use this option to report any issues, leave feedback, or to suggest improvments related to the Fiddler Jam portal. The submited logs are reviewed directly by the core team developers and support engineers.

Behind the scenes, the used techonoly is called **Fiddler Jam Embedded** and demonstrates how you could integrate Fiddler Jam logs directly into your own website. [Learn more about how to submit an issue here...]({%slug fj-report-issue%})
