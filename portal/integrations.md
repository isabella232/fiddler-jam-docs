# Third-Party Integrations

You can link all Jam logs which are added to and are part of a portal workspace to third-party tracking solutions. 

Currently, the Jam portal supports integrations with the following services:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/) issues.

- [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) projects.

- [Trello](https://trello.com/en) boards.


## Linking Jam Logs to GitHub Issues

You can link a Jam log to a new GitHub issue or add it to an existing one. 

### Linking a Log to a New GitHub Issue

To link a Jam log to a new GitHub issue:
