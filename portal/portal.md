# Fiddler Jam Portal

The [Fiddler Jam portal](https://jam.getfiddler.com) is the cloud space where the recorded logs from the extension can be submitted. The Fiddler Jam portal is accessible only for users with active [Fiddler Jam portal subscriptions](#subscriptions).


## Portal

The [Fiddler Jam portal](https://jam.getfiddler.com) is accessible for all users with an active seat. The Fiddler Jam login accepts using custom credentials or Google authentication, but the portal will be accessible only for usernames/emails that are part of an active subscription. Depending on the user assigned role, the Fiddler Jam portal will provide a different level of accessibility and features as follows:

- Unregistered users won't be able to open the Fiddler Jam portal or load generated Fiddler Jam links.
- Registered users with the **viewer** role can see only logs added to a workspace. If a viewer opens a public link, a page will inform the user that the links need to be added to the account workspace.
Registered users with the **editor** role can open public logs (automatically added to workspace), create and manage workspaces, manage existing logs (manage, add and remove from workspaces).
