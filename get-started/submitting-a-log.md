# Submitting a Log

Fiddler Jam logs can be submitted to the [Fiddler Jam portal]({%slug fj-portal%}) and shared with portal users via email or a direct link. You can easily submit a log in a few steps:

1. [Record a log]({%slug fj-recording-logs%}).

1. From the [**Sharing options**]({%slug fj-link-options%}), set the access level for the recorded log (public or shared with specific people) and optionally [protect the log with a password]({%slug fj-link-options%}#password-protection-for-recorded-logs).

   The default drop-down selection is **Share with link**, which will create a public link. Click **Get Link** to submit the recorded Fiddler JAM log and generate a sharable link. The link points to the cloud space in the Jam portal that contains the submitted log. This URL is accessible only for Fiddler Jam [portal users]({%slug fj-users%}#portal-users) with the appropriate access rights.

   Alternatively, you could select **Share with specific people**, which will create a link only for the portal users added explicitly via their account email. Click **Share Captured Logs** to submit the recorded Fiddler JAM log. This action sends an email notification to the specified recipients and then generates a shareable link. Simultaneously, the log is uploaded to the Fiddler Jam cloud space. This URL is accessible only for Fiddler Jam [portal users]({%slug fj-users%}#portal-users) with the appropriate access rights.
