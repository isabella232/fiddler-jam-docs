# Submitting a Log

Logs captured by the Fiddler Jam extension can be submitted to the [Fiddler Jam portal]({%slug fj-portal%}), shared with portal users via email, or saved as [JSON-formatted archive (**HAR**)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAR_(file_format)).

## Submit via Link

Collaboration is the main feature of Fiddler Jam. Submitting a recorded log is easy and can be achieved in few easy steps:

1. [Record a log]({%slug fj-recording-logs%}).
2. From the [**Link Generation options**]({%slug fj-link-options%}) select the access level you would like to apply to the recorded logs. The default drop-down selection is **Anyone with this link** but you could also create a password-protected link (**Anyone with link and password** option) or share the recorded logs with a specific people via email (**Share with specific people** option).
3. Based on the choice made in the previous steps:
    - _When choosing **Anyone with this link** or **Anyone with link and password** option:_ Click on **Get Link** to submit the generated log. The action generates a sharable link for the current user. Simultaneously, the log is uploaded to the Fiddler Jam cloud space.
    - _When choosing **Share with specific people** option:_ Click on **Share Captured Logs** to submit the generated log. The action generates a shareable link for the current user and sends an email containing a link to the email recipients' recorded log. Simultaneously, the log is uploaded to the Fiddler Jam cloud space.
4. Click on **Copy URL** to store the unique URL to your machine's clipboard. Use this link to share the recorded logs with other Fiddler Jam portal users.

>tip Logs submitted to the Fiddler Jam portal are **not** publicly available. Only Fiddler Jam [portal users]({%slug fj-users%}#portal-users) with [the proper access rights]({%slug fj-link-options%}) will are able to open a submitted log.
