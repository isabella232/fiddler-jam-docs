# Submitting a Log

Logs captured by the Fiddler Jam extension can be submitted to the [Fiddler Jam portal]({%slug fj-portal%}), shared with portal users via email, or saved as a [JSON-formatted archive (**HAR**)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAR_(file_format)).

## Submit via Link

Collaboration is the main feature of Fiddler Jam. You can easily submit a log in a few steps:

1. [Record a log]({%slug fj-recording-logs%}).

2. From the [**Link Generation options**]({%slug fj-link-options%}), select the access level you would like to apply to the recorded logs.

   The default drop-down selection is **Anyone with this link**. You could also create a password-protected link by using the **Anyone with link and password** option or share the recorded logs with specific people via email by using the **Share with specific people** option.

    - If you selected **Anyone with this link** or **Anyone with link and password**: Click **Get Link** to submit the generated log. This generates a sharable link for the current user. Simultaneously, the log is uploaded to the Fiddler Jam cloud.

    - If you selected **Share with specific people**: Click **Share Captured Logs** to submit the generated log. This sends an email notification to the specified recipients and then generates a shareable link. Simultaneously, the log is uploaded to the Fiddler Jam cloud. Only the log creator and the specified recipients can view the log.

3. Click **Copy URL** to store the unique URL to your machine's clipboard. Use this link to share the recorded logs with other Fiddler Jam portal users.

>tip Logs submitted to the Fiddler Jam portal **are private**. Only Fiddler Jam [portal users]({%slug fj-users%}#portal-users) with [the proper access rights]({%slug fj-link-options%}) are able to open a submitted log.
