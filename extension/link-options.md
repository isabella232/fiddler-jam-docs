# Sharing Options

The Fiddler Jam extension provides two options for sharing [recorded logs]({%slug fj-recording-logs%}). Both alternatives allow additional security via [password protection](#password-protection-for-recorded-logs).

- [Share with a link](#share-with-a-link)
- [Share with specific people](#share-with-specific-people)

## Share with a Link

Link sharing allows [registered Fiddler Jam portal users]({%slug fj-users%}#portal-users) to open a recorded log, if they have the link. The log can be additionally [protected with a password](#password-protection-for-recorded-logs).

Only registered [Fiddler Jam portal users]({%slug fj-users%}#portal-users) with the appropriate rights will have access to the recorded information.

## Share with specific people

This option allows you to list specific users via their emails. Only users explicitly listed in the email list will be able to open the recorded log. Additionally, the log could be protected with a password by enabling the **Password protection** switch. The password must be at least eight characters long, must contain at least one lowercase, one uppercase, and one number.

The email recipients need to be [Fiddler Jam portal users]({%slug fj-users%}#portal-users) with the appropriate rights.
